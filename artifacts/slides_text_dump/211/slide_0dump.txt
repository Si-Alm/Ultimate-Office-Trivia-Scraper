â„¢ ALTHOUGH I LOVE THIS ACCOUNT MORE THAN
ALMOST ANYTHING IN THE WORLD, I HAVE DECIDED
TO STEP DOWN FROM MY POST AND SPEND MORE
TIME WITH MY FAMILY. | DO NOT FEAR THE
UNKNOWN. I WILL MEET MY NEW CHALLENGES
HEAD-ON AND I WILL SUCCEED, AND I WILL LAUGH
IN THE FACES OF THOSE WHO DOUBT ME. IT'S BEEN A
PLEASURE WORKING WITH SOME OF YOU, AND |
WILL NOT FORGET THOSE OF YOU SOON. BUT
REMEMBER, WHILE TODAY IT IS ME, WE ALL SHALL
FALL... INOTHER WORDS, I'M DONE POSTING
CONTENT ON THIS ACCOUNT."
